    Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility,
    artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, Swift is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century.
<br> Swift began songwriting professionally at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country musician. Under Bi
g Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country radio, starting with her self-titled album (2006).
 Her next record, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) incorporated rock influences, and Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She abandoned her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired her next album, the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017), and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
